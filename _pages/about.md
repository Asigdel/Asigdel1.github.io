I am a statistical geneticist, currently working as a Research Associate at [Dr. Rosa's lab](https://www.gjmrosa.org/) (University of Wisconsin-Madison). My research interests include quantitative genetics, machine learning and data analytics. My overarching research goal is to understand the genotype-phenotype map in livestock species using statistical genetics. Iâ€™m interested in better understanding the genetic architecture of economically important traits and also applying and developing statistical methods for prediction in the multi-omics era.
